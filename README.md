This program is based on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs) video
from Numberphile. The basic idea is this:

* Draw three points (my program uses the vertices of an invisible equilateral triangle)
* Draw a point at random
* Draw another point halfway (1:1) between the original point and a random vertex
* Draw another point halfway (1:1) between this new point and another randomly chosen vertex
* Repeat ad nauseam

The result is the [Sierpi≈Ñski triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle)

I've taken it a step further and allowed the number of vertices to be increased,
allowed the ratio of original-point-to-vertex to be changed, and the number of dots
to be changed.

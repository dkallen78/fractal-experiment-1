# fractal-experiment-1

This program is based on this (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs) video
from Numberphile. The basic idea is this:

*Draw three points (my program uses the vertices of an invisible equilateral triangle)
*Draw a point at random
*Draw another point halfway between the original point and a random vertex
*Draw another point halfway between this new point and another randomly chosen vertex
Repeat ad nauseum

The result is the Sierpi≈Ñski triangle

I've taken it a step further and allowed the number of vertices to be increased,
allowed the ratio of original-point-to-vertex to be changed, and the number of dots
to be changed.
